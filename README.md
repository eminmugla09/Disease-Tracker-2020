# Disease-Tracker-2020
With the disease tracker, health providers or goverments agents can  potentiality of tracking their patients is way better. Creating a Quarantine Zone and get they can join into this zone with  quarantine zone name id will give at private trackin as real-time with live location data that you continuously fetch. While doing all this, you may create a new quarantine zone.

The purpose that I aimed while developing this project is to improve and practice the knowledge implementation that I learned lately on always running background services, firebase and Google Maps Api

Built With
The project structure that I have decided to do is to create all remote services on my own by using "Firebase" and do all the location fetch & writes. For creating the code architecture that  I applied kotlin and it's features with better understanding. Tried to decrease the dependencies with coin and do the remote work as asynchronous with kotlin coroutines. The location updates applied on the map by setting member markers with Google Maps.

The most important task of the app is to listen to location updates of members and send current user location to the family is achieved by creating an "always running background service".
